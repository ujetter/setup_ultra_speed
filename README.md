# Setup Ultra Speed
Contains tipps how to enhance the speed of my Asus Zenbook 14 UX3405MA with Intel Core Ultra 7 155H

It happens that I have aquired a Asus Zenbook 15 UX3405MA. After that I found out that the setting of Windows and the drivers are not as good as they are.

This page contains some tweaks and in the respective issues that I have with that zenbook and how I resolved them.
Especially speeding up the boot time and how to reduce the lag of Citrix VDI connections are hacks that iprove the performance dramatically and hence are recomended to a wider audience.

I have written this respository, because updates of the citrix software will result in deletion of the registry keys and revert the settings - so I need a space where to run them again from.
